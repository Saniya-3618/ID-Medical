NHSP Requirements Cancellation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:-
	IDMedical require the such a requirements that are fulfilled and removed from the portal. That requirement's are need to mark as a cancelled requirement.

PreRequisites:-
	We require the results (unfilled requirements) from the 3 days and 28 days scrapping functionality

Solution:-
	1) Once the results from the 3 days and 28 days scrapping are available and the requirements cancellation scheduler
	   is triggered, we will compare two conjugative execution results/ output excel. (We will compare 3 days results with
	   3 days and 28 results with 28 days only)
	2) After comparison, find out the difference of requirement which are present previously but now its not available in the unfilled
	   requirements excel.
	3) If we find any difference in the requirements then these requirement will be further compare with the filled requirements.
	4) Then will scrape the filled requirements (by agency and by bank) from the NHSP portal (3 days and 28 days filled requirements seperatly).
	5) Then from the difference of the unfilled requirements remove the requirements which are filled by agency, so that we
	   will get the requirements which are filled by the bank and the requirements which are completly missing from the portal.
	6) And will save these requirements in the cancelled requirements excel.
	7) Generated cancellation requirements files will be checked in job cancellation scheduler (Java) and the requirements
	   will be updated to clarity through cancellation API.
